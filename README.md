# KnowU

KnowU is a personality test app that uses your responses to 32 questions to establish your personality type.
It gives people the ability to use self-awareness whenever and wherever they need it.
It provides you with a clear picture of yourself and assists you in selecting the best job for you. You can learn about your limitations and strengths that you may not be aware of.
You can post your personality type on our app and connect with others who are a good match for you.
The ability to interact with and chat with compatible individuals via our app will be added to the project's future scope.

## Why KnowU?
Sometimes we think we know ourselves, which is fine, but it's not always clear like :
- What we want? 
- What makes us happy? 
- What are our skills and shortcomings?
- How do we act? 
- What do people think of us?
- What is the best career for us? 
- How should we handle people? 
- How we are as a leader and as a team member?
- Where we fit in? 
- Which personality types are compatible with us?
and much much more.
This is why the software is called **KnowU**.
All you have to do is learn about yourself, progress, and have fun :)




## How it is helpful?

Personality development is also important for enhancing communication abilities. Individuals should learn how to convey their thoughts and feelings in the most effective way possible. Knowing your personality can help you understand yourself and people around you better. It can help you recognise your strengths and limitations, understand your feelings and actions, and regulate your behaviour in a variety of scenarios. You'll be able to determine where you belong and what you need to do in order to succeed.
